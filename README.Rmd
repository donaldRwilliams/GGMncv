# GGMncv

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/donaldRwilliams/GGMncv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/donaldRwilliams/GGMncv)

The goal of GGMncv is to provide non-convex penalties for estimating Gaussian graphical models. These are known 
to overcome the various limitations of lasso, including (but not limited to) consistent model selection, nearly unbiased estimates, and a lower false positive rate.

## Installation

You can install the released version of GGMncv from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("GGMncv")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("donaldRwilliams/GGMncv")
```


## Penalties
The following are implemented in `GGMncv`

1. Arctan (X). This is currently the default (`penalty = "atan"`).

2. Seamless L0  [`penalty = "selo"`; @dicker2013variable]

3. Exponential (`penalty = "exp"`)

4. Smoothly clipped absolute deviation (`penalty = scad`)

5. Minimax concave penalty (`penalty = mcp`)
