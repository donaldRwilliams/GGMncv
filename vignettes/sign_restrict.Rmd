# Introduction
For some research questions, there might be expectations for
the directions of the relations. For example, in symptom networks,
all relations are often hypothesized to be positive. In turn,
any negative relations are thought to be spurious.

In **GGMncv**, it is possible to estimate the conditional 
dependence structure, given that all edges in the graph are 
positive (sign restriction).

## Packages
```{r setup}
library(GGMncv)
library(corrplot)
```

## Data
The `ptsd` dataset includes 20 post-traumatic stress symptoms.
The following visualizes the correlation matrix.

```{r}
corrplot::corrplot(cor(ptsd), method = "shade")
```
